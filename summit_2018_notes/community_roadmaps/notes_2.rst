Session Questions:

rOpenSci has multiple proposals. Roadmaps are challenging bc they do a lot of distinct things, and each one has its roadmap.
Reviewing software packages: right now scope is very limited out of necessity. Proposal to expand into reviewing statistical tools. Assemble a board and (paid) editors to do that.
They roadmap 3x a year. Use most recent roadmap as a form of accountability.

PyTables has an out-of-date, unmaintained roadmap.
Make pytables a layer on top of H5PY -- lacks anyone to do it

Conda-forge doesn’t have a release structure, so a bit odd. No roadmap, a lot of discussions about roadmaps.
Vastly expand CI and build infrastructure resources
Expand platforms we can build on
Expand other package managers, like wheels for pip and spack
Make internal bot stack more deployable to other systems
Community-wise, get more people involved in core team with more diversity initiatives
1k people in org, 15 or 16 are core team developers

nteract has a 2018-2019 roadmap and some lofty goals for 2020.
Building community, establishing better documentation and setups to increase developer evangelism
Improving contributor and user documentation: increase # maintainers and corporate adoption
Technical goals: real-time server side of nteract notebook
Improving robustness of desktop app
Improving data science deployment pipeline
Improving ability to have extensions
Better, more seamless and accessible UX 

Astropy has roadmap of “what we think NSF would fund.” No written roadmap; probably in google docs from coordination meetings. There’s consensus but no written document.
Functionality to deal with spectroscopy
Greatly expand tutorials, educational resources
Project management consult for a revised management structure, esp. now that there will be money to pay people
Ways to foster international collaboration and int’l funding support (not so U.S.-centric)

Share-Out:
Plenty of focus and energy on technical features; need more emphasis on community-building, educational, inclusion resources.


Part 2: List user groups and personas that would be impacted by the work.

Pain Points for users
How pain points would be resolved if work is completed.

Astropy tutorials project: has many user groups that it impacts from HS students learning to code, amateur astronomers, undergrads, senior researchers learning Python for the first time. Pain point is making an easy entree for folks who aren’t coders but know that they need to code. Giving them positive feelings about the Astropy community. Creates good base of people who will become contributors & devs over the long term.

Ppl who want to use nteract as: scientists, hobbyists, developers, academics, folks with no technical background. Connects to docs and outreach work: channels to reach those folks (blog posts, SEO, documentation, etc.) 

Conda-forge personas are broad: sometimes CF is the second thing they learn to do at all. People who have a long, rich history of knowing how to build software. User-users are a lot of people. Convert more of those people into maintainers. Transitioning them could be a lot smoother.

PyTables -- most users come from pandas and don’t even know they’re using PyTables.

rOpenSci has 3 major personas: developer, scientist who’s not a dev, people who do both. Get scientists to take more ownership; give tasks they might be interested in; get them to do something in collaboration with a developer; feel more comfortable on their own after doing a collab PR. Get the bus factor higher.
